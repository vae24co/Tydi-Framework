_**Tydi™ Framework** is a collection for developing web solutions (websites, applications, APIs & PWA) using vanilla languages of the web & related technology (PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript). [Tydi](https://tydi.vae24.org "Tydi")™ was initially designed, built, and maintained by [AO](https://osawere.com/about?ref=tydi.repo "Anthony Osawere")™ (**Anthony Osawere**) as part of the BRUX™ System Design for [VAE24™ Inc](https://vae24.com "VAE24™ Inc") and released under its open-source initiative._


## Impression
Tydi™ as a web framework, intentionally aims to be native and flexible in helping you swiftly write simple but powerful code for your application and API. Constantly evolving, Tydi Framework is cool for developing modem responsive static or dynamic websites, database-driven web applications, prototypes, APIs, and other web services quickly, yet efficiently while maintaining as minimal a small footprint as possible and respecting your workflow as a developer.

Tydi™ Framework is free and open-source, maintaining vanilla languages combined with clean code separation using a derivative of model–view–controller architecture.
